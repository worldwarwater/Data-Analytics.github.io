```
- This adds up all electricity consumption values in column `H`.  

### 3️⃣ Identifying Cities with Maximum & Minimum Consumption
Used **Pivot Tables & Conditional Formatting** to highlight:  
- **Top 10 cities with the highest electricity consumption** (Industry purpose).  
- **Cities with the highest consumption in Public Water Works & Street Lights**.  

---

## 📊 Key Findings & Trends
- The **top 10 cities with the highest electricity consumption** were identified, showing where reduction efforts could be focused.
